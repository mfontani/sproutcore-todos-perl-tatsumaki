- GET /tasks - request should return all of the tasks defined for the current user.
- GET taskURL - the task for a specific URL.
- POST /tasks - request will create a new task, assigning it a unique guid.
    It should return a 201 with a Location header for the new record.
- PUT taskURL - request will update the state of a specified task
- DELETE taskURL - request will delete the specified task

For our design, each taskâ€™s GUID will be the URL that it actually belongs to.

Each request above accepts and posts JSON as its primary payload.

Each record is formatted as a simple data hash like so:
{ 
    "guid": "/task/123",   
    "description": "Task description"   
    "isDone": true | false 
} 

Here is the example format when you retrieve the data for a single task:
{   
    "content": {       
        "guid": "/task/123",     
        "description": "Task description",     
        "order": 1,     
        "isDone": false  
    } 
}

For the index request (that returns all of the tasks), the content property is simply an array of data hashes:
{   
    content: [      
         { 
             "guid": "/task/123",       
             "description": "Task description",       
             "order": 1,       
             "isDone": false 
         },      
         { 
             "guid": "/task/345",       
             "description": "Task description",       
             "order": 2,       
             "isDone": false 
         }    
    ] 
}
